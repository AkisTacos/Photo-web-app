We cleaned up the design to be more user optimized.  
For example, we reduced the number of clicks to filter from two to one.
We reduced the number of clicks to add tags to one. We wanted to do this because making the user click more means
more work for the user, which creates an user unfriendly design.

The hamburger menu is replaced with simple UI elements that are on top of the page.  This takes away the right hand side 
and gives more room for the images to display.
